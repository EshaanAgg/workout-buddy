# üîñ Workout Buddy

A simple add to store your workout routines. Made with Nuxt 3 and Appwrite.

If you simply want to try out the app, go ahead and check out the demo at (ADD LINK)

## üé¨ Getting Started

### ü§ò Install Appwrite

Follow the simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice.

> Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend can access it.

We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server.

1. Add a new Web App in Appwrite and enter the endpoint of your website (`localhost, <project-name>.vercel.app etc`)
   ![Appwrite Console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31401437/155891052-09bb17e4-a30c-4c73-8c9f-b1cc0b44c596.png)

2. Create a new database, and then a new collection with the following properties.

- **Attributes**
  Add the following attributes to the collection.
  > Make sure that your Attribute ID exactly matches the key in the images

### üöÄ Deploy the Front End

You have two options to deploy the front-end and we will cover both of them here. In either case, you will need to fill in these environment variables that help your frontend connect to Appwrite.

- VITE_APP_ENDPOINT - Your Appwrite endpoint
- VITE_APP_PROJECT - Your Appwrite project ID
- VITE_APP_COLLECTION_ID - Your Appwrite collection ID
- VITE_APP_DATABASE_ID - Your Appwrite database ID

### **Deploy to a Static Hosting Provider**

Use the following buttons to deploy to your favourite hosting provider in one click! We support Vercel, Netlify and DigitalOcean. You will need to enter the environment variables above when prompted.

> Note: Vercel is unable to auto detect the framework so please use the Vue Framework in case of vercel.
